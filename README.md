# ETO React Playground

This is a personal project where I explore and recreate patterns and components used by the [Emerging Technology Observatory](https://eto.tech) web platform.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Familiarize myself with the frontend architecture and tooling used by ETO
- Experiment with alternative approaches (e.g., recreating charts using D3 instead of react-plotly)
- Explore and visualize data from ETO AGORA (AI Governance and Regulatory Archive)

This is not a production-ready application, but rather a sandbox for technical learning and experimentation.

## Notes

This project is **unaffiliated** with ETO and intended purely for educational purposes.
